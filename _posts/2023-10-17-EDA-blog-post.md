## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The strategy I would use for EDA would be to start with the overall dataset, concentrating first on the big picture, and then slowly narrow down with targeted inquiries to test different hypotheses and further explore the data to find what useful insights it can provide. To get an overall sense of the dataset, I would look for what types of data are included, how much data there is, and whether there is any missing data. I would then begin to explore the data deeper through a few different methods. Methods I think are important to consider in EDA include numerical summaries of relevant statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation, as well as using charts and plots to try and look for significant patterns, correlations, and anything that could imply important outliers and anomalies.

Ultimately, my overall goal when doing an EDA is to be able to thoroughly investigate a dataset and then summarize the data contained within in a clear and helpful way, such as through key insights and well-formatted visualizations.
