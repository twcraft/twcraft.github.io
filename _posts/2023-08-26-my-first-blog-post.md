## This is my first blog post

I think being a data scientist is about working with large amounts of _big data_ in order to aid businesses and other stakeholders in informed decision making and projecting for the future.

I see the major duties of a data scientist as gathering data, analyzing data, and then ultimately organizing the data in such a way as to be able to present useful business insights. Thus, some of the knowledge areas of a data scientist include statistics, mathematics, computer science, as well as knowledge in specialized fields such as business and the natural sciences.

Both data scientists and statisticians need expertise in the areas of statistical and data analyses and a background in mathematics and programming languages, as well as skills in problem solving and communication. However, some differences between the two roles include a difference in focus on practical versus theoretical implications, different approaches to data analysis, and working in different types of industries.

At this time, I view myself as more in the realm of a data scientist as I hope to apply my newly developing skills in statistical and data anaylsis to offer insights in fields where I have previously gained experience and specialized knowledge.
