Welcome to my blog home page.

My name is Tiffany Craft and I am currently a student at North Carolina State University studying applied statistics and data management. This blog will be a place for me to practice my newly developing skills in this area and contain blog posts to that effect. Throughout my studies, I hope to learn more about the following programming langauges:
* SAS
* R
* Python
