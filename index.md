Welcome to my blog home page.

My name is Tiffany Craft and I am currently a student at North Carolina State University studying applied statistics and data management. This blog will be a place for me to practice my newly developing skills in this area and contain blog posts to that effect. Throughout my studies, I hope to learn more about the following programming langauges:
* SAS
* R
* Python

My hope is to eventually become a data scientist. Currently, the way I feel about data science is more like this:

```{r ggplot2_img, echo=FALSE, out.width = "70px", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://datasciencedojo.com/wp-content/uploads/16-995x1030.jpeg)https://datasciencedojo.com/wp-content/uploads/16-995x1030.jpeg")
```

That is all.
